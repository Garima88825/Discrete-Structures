Dicrete Structures Programs List

Program 1 : Write a program to create a SET A and determine the cardinality of SET for an input array of elements (repetition allowed) and perform the following operations on the SET:
a) ismember (a, A): check whether an element belongs to set or not and return value as true/false.
b) powerset A): list all the elements of power set of A.


Program 2 : Create a class SET and take two sets as input from user to perform following SET Operations:
a) Subset: Check whether one set is a subset of other or not.
b) Union and Intersection of two Sets.
c) Complement: Assume Universal Set as per the input elements from the user.
d) Set Difference and Symmetric Difference between two SETS.
e) Cartesian Product of Sets.


Program 3 : Create a class RELATION, use Matrix notation to represent a relation. Include functions to check if a relation is reflexive, Symmetric, Anti-symmetric and Transitive. Write a program to use this class.


Program 4 : Use the functions defined in Ques 3 to find check whether the given relation is:
a) Equivalent, or
b) Partial Order relation, or
c) None


Program 5 : Write a Program to generate the Fibonacci Series using recursion.


Program 6 : Write a Program to implement Tower of Hanoi using recursion.


Program 7 : Write a Program to implement binary search using recursion.


Program 8 : Write a Program to implement Bubble Sort. Find the number of comparisons during each pass and display the intermediate result. Use the observed values to plot a graph to analyse the complexity of algorithm.


Program 9 : Write a Program to implement Insertion Sort. Find the number of comparisons during each pass and display the intermediate result. Use the observed values to plot a graph to analyse the complexity of algorithm.


Program 10 : Write a Program that generates all the permutations of a given set of digits, with or without repetition. (For example, if the given set is {1,2}, the permutations are 12 and 21). (One method is given in Liu).


Program 11 : Write a Program to calculate Permutation and Combination for an input value n and r using recursive formula of nCr and nPr.


Program 12 : For any number n, write a program to list all the solutions of the equation x1+ x2 + x3 + …+ xn = C, where C is a constant (C<=10) and x1,x2, x3, … ,xn are nonnegative integers using brute force strategy.
Program 13 : Write a Program to accept the truth values of variables x and y, and print the truth table of the following logical operations:
a) Conjunction	f) Exclusive NOR
b) Disjunction	g) Negation
c) Exclusive OR	h) NAND
d) Conditional	i) NOR
e) Bi-conditional	


Program 14 : Write a program to accept an input n from the user and graphically represent the values of T (n) where n varies from 0 to n for the recurrence relations. For e.g. T(n) = T(n-1) + n, T(0) = 1, T(n) = T(n-1) + n^2, T(0) =1, T(n) = 2*T(n)/2 + n, T(1)=1.


Program 15 : Write a Program to store a function (polynomial/exponential), and then evaluate the polynomial, (For example store f (x) = 4n3 + 2n + 9 in an array and for a given value of n, say n = 5, evaluate (i.e. compute the value of f(5)).


Program 16 : Write a Program to represent Graphs using the Adjacency Matrices and check if it is a complete graph.


Program 17 : Write a Program to accept a directed graph G and compute the in-degree and out-degree of each vertex.


Program 18 : Given a graph G, write a Program to find the number of paths of length n between the source and destination entered by the user.


Program 19 : Given an adjacency matrix of a graph, write a program to check whether a given set of vertices {v1, v2, v3 … , vk} forms an Euler path / Euler Circuit (for circuit assume vk = v1).


Program 20 : Given a full m-ary tree with i internal vertices, write a program to find the number of leaf nodes.
